             Hi! My name is Sant Surat.
                My birthplace is Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. In my childhood, I always used to wonder whenever I play games
                on
                computer that How those animations and every step of GTA works just after clicking a button. If I recall
                those memories then I find that yahoo.com used to be a very popular website those days.
